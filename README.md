## 💡 Why?

Javascript diagramming libraries are often difficult to integrate in React projects. <br />
Different patterns not always fit the React nature and having a component's state in in sync with an external
diagramming library might be quite difficult especially when the latter had been built in a different paradigm (such as MVC, for example).

For this reason we created `beautiful-react-diagrams` an easy-to-customise functional diagramming library to build 
diagrams with ease.

## 🎓 Principles

- **Lightweights**: import nothing but a single lightweight javascript.
- **Controlled components**: exports [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) components only.
- **Renderers**: the involved components can be easily replaced with your own by using the  `renderer` props.
- **Easy to style**: built using CSS vars only.

## ☕️ Features

* Concise API
* Small and lightweight
* Easy to use
* Easy to customise
